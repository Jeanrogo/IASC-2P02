## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jeanrogo/IASC-2P02/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
<!--	Exported from Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org).
The iframe src attribute below uses a relative protocol to better function with both
http and https sites, but if you're embedding this into a local web page (file protocol)
you should add an explicit protocol (https if you're using voyant-tools.org, otherwise
it depends on this server.
Feel free to change the height and width values or other styling below: -->
<iframe style='width: 477px; height: 399px;' src='https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=culture&query=cultural&corpus=e36f1b665689902d8a5f5ad06bbd1e94'></iframe>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jeanrogo/IASC-2P02/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
