## PROMPT
Both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multi-modal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so on). Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital humanities scholarship from scholarship in the sciences. 



## BLOG POST
The argument that visual forms can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena is justifiable from both Moretti and Drucker’s points of view.  Moretti points out the beneficial use of graphs in explanation of a certain culture through his graphs mostly showing the production of books across different time periods and countries. As much as there is the textual information provided regarding the publishing of books, the use of visual diagrams enables a reader to view various events that may have occurred prior to the books been published, such as discovering the plot of the book, editing the book, and eventually publishing the book which could have taken a few years but that isn’t shown through the textual representation of the books being published. Moretti refers to textual information as quantitative data that is defined as being ideally independent of interpretations(taken as is). 

Meanwhile, Drucker’s perspective on data representation in the visual format is different in its own way. He claims that we re-conceive all data as capta.  Capta is the 'data of the conscious experience'.  Drucker targets the interpretation and representation of data or capta in this case through the humanistic, qualitative angle. Qualitative data could be based on the classification of participants according to properties and attributes which in this case relates back to the point of data being capta and the humanistic approach means that “the premises are rooted in the recognition of the interpretative nature of knowledge, that the display itself is conceived to embody qualitative expressions, and that the information is understood as graphically constituted. “

In relation to the creation of more multi-modal scholarship with a support of data being represented through not only text but visual forms as well, Julia Flanders claims that  Digital humanities scholarship now includes an awareness of the representational significance of medium as a fundamental premise. This is not only because the digital medium is seen as a kind of meta-medium in which other media can be modeled or represented (which requires us to think about the special characteristics of those other media, for modeling purposes), but also because the digital medium itself is not representation-ally  uniform. She believes that digital scholarships should have collaborations with other fields that challenge the notion of the digital humanities discipline claiming that digital scholarships embody unresolved conflicts about scale, human effort, and nature of digital work. Her view on humanistic scholarships, a complete u-turn from the digital sector is that it has been focused on high labor craft activities where care and precision matter regardless of the availability of digital resources. “Humanistic study is all about representation: it is about decoding, understanding, historicizing, and critiquing the representational modes and artifacts of the past and present, and reflecting on what they tell us about human culture. But while we are good at distancing ourselves critically from the representational forms we encounter in the materials we study, we’re surprisingly less so when it comes to the modes we use ourselves. One of the most significant contributions of the digital humanities on modern scholarship is precisely to foreground issues of how we model the sources we study, in such a way that they cannot be sidestepped. “  Scholars don’t have a close connection with the digital resources that are offered to them and end up being alienated from the technology because they don’t care about and this should be changed.

In Christine Borgman’s essay, The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities, in the digital humanities field in this current day is in a critical position due to budget cuts in most institutions and marginal programs are eliminated which from my perspective, she could be referring to digital humanities as an example and she claims that only scholars are in the position to move the digital humanities field forward hence the creation of multi-modal scholarships is beneficial both to scholars and the field itself. Christine further discusses that the experiences from the science field offers valuable lessons such as data collection, distribution among others and this is the norm in science but still experimental in digital humanities. So the creation of multi-modal scholarships could enhance the collaboration of the science and humanities field rather than keep them apart.

Personally, I believe that the creation of more multi-modal scholarships in the digital humanities department is quite essential and will differentiate this department from other scholarships because it engages scholars in actively doing research in the specific topic they are exploring. Being able to come up with a visual representation of the textual information they have acquired can be quite incentive especially covering certain topics where data isn’t just a bunch of  numbers proving something but the data is represented as capta which involves the human conscience, emotions are in play among other human characteristics. Furthermore the creation of multi-modal scholarships can enable students have a feel for a digital approach in a field that has been long known for textual representation. Providing them with a different or more efficient way to represent information than focusing on high labor input. 

Moretti and Drucker both claim that data representation should and can be in visual forms while Flanders and Borgman focus on how this data representation, research, collection etc could influence the creation of more multi-modal scholarships distinguishing the digital humanities field from other fields in terms of scholarships.
